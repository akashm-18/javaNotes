stack and heaps are responsible for the storing the values in Java.

Here, Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out)
Heap is FIFO(First In First Out)

// Comes to the storing data part.

All it starts from the main method.

It creates a stack for the main method.
Then stores the value in (key-value) pairs.
Like we have int value = 33;
in stack it store in key-value (value = 33);

Then comes the reference variable obj.
It created using the calculator class.

Here the obj stored with key-value pair of (obj = memory Address of obj)
Because when we creating the obj (reference-variable) 
It created in the Heap.
Heap have two sections. one for variables and one for methods
Here in calculator class we have 
1) num = 10; (Instance variable);
2) add method.Heap only have the method.Not its implemetation.

Implemetation for add it created using the stack.
Here new stack (add)
Which has num1 = 3
Which has num2 = 6

Stack always links with the heap.
Stack needs to get the memory Address of the obj.
Then it gets the return value for result.
Which will stored in the main method.
With Key-value (result = 9)

objects are stored in the heap with memory Address.

If we create another object this created in heap with another new memory Address


// These all happens using the JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
